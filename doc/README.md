### Doc folder

The doc directory contains the report or presentation files. It can have subfolders. 

The Project3_Group4_report.pdf is the report for challenge I.

The Quick_Start_Guide_for_Colab_users.ipynb used Google Colab to make a quickstart notebook.

The St - a Hugging Face Space by puqi.pdf is the pdf format of the hugging face app, and its original link is: https://huggingface.co/spaces/puqi/climsim

The data_loader_huggingface.ipynb reads the data from the Huggingface hub, without the need of downloading it on our local system. It is an easier and more convenient way of loading the data for our use, without interfering with the local machine's space.
